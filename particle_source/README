Source for Particle Device:  cellTest.ino
	cellTest.ino will work on either cell-enabled or regular partical devices
	It requires a library HC_SR04 (NOT HC-SR04)

Wiring: Connect an HC-SR04 Range finder as follows:
	Spark   HC-SR04
	GND     GND
	5V      VCC
	D4      Trig
	D5      Voltage divider output - see below

	Echo ---|
       		>
       		< 470 ohm
       		>
       		---------- D5 on Particle device
       		>
       		< 470 ohm
       		>
	GND ----|

	I think the above resistors are for 5V to 3.3 conversion.  If so
	I'd have picked something like 720 on bottom to get the swing closer to 3.3V

This example sketch will issue "write_distance" events to the particle cloud.
You should be able to see them in the console->events window.
To get that data to a database, we use a "webhook".  Go to the console->integrations->new-integration->webhook
	EventName:  write_distance
	URL: http://198.58.97.240/reidtest/write_distance.cgi
	Request Type: GET
	Request Format:  Query parameters
	Device:  any (or pick just one, but then the webhook will only work for one device)

Persistant Data should now be available in a mysql database on that server (198.58.97.240)
